# DigiDrop - Unity

> A mobile game project created in Unity 3D.

## Game Description: 
Objects fall around the player and he/she has to look around with their phone -- while staying on their seat -- to catch those falling collectibles under a time limit.

## Project Background:
This project was created as a proof-of-concept for an add-on event of an app to make things more exciting for the app users and increase usage.

## 'Looking around' mechanic:
The game uses the phone's `Gyroscope` to detect the real-world rotation of the phone to make the catching of falling objects possible. However, there is the issue that **not all smartphones have gyroscope on them**. To allow players with lower-end phones to play the game even without gyroscope, the game project offers the usage of another script to use `Accelerometer` instead of the Gyroscope for the same purpose.

## Real-world as background == Illusion of Augmented Reality
The game utilizes the camera of the mobile device to display the real world as its background. This gives the illusion that the falling objects the player has to collect are part of Augmented Reality.
